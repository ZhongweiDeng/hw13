## Summary

The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by different cars speeding along with it. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill, which results in a death and a restart of the game. After the road, there is a median strip separating the two major parts of the screen. The upper portion of the screen consists of a river with logs moving horizontally across the screen. By jumping on swiftly moving logs the player can guide their frog to safety.

## Component Parts

1.The frog that controled by the player
2.The moving cars on the road
3.The logs on the river
4.The background music
5.The sound of jumping
6.The background image I designed

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write Proposal
- Week 2: Flush out initial code for the idea
- Week 3: Add features and increase the completeness of the game
- Week 4: Solve bugs and present to the class
 
## Challenges

It was really hard to have all the moving components animate together. I did some research and learned how to make it in a series of tutoral videos on youtube. However, the cars, logs and the frog cannot move together with a gif background. In this project, p5 editor only kept the first frame of my background gif. I wanted to make the river animating together with all the components moving but it seems like p5 doesn't support this function.
